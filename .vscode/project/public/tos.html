            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>Please take a moment to read through our ToS. Unlike others, we make our
                ToS easily <b>readable and short</b> so please don't just skim through it. We want
                you to be informed! If its still too long, there is a <b>TLDR</b> in each section.</p><br>
            <button class="accordion"><h3>Rules and Expectations</h3></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Since there are people under 18 in our community, expectations on our
                    users are particularly important. We keep our rules nice and simple.
                    Except in extreme cases such as sexual harassment or death threats, 
                    we run by a three-strike system. Failure to abide to the rules below 
                    after three warnings will result in suspension or ban.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p><b>Be respectful of others.</b> We do not tolerate
                    intolerance. Please be civil in your discussions with others and have 
                    good faith when debating. On stricter terms, do not insult others or
                    discriminate against race, gender, etc... Do not engage in hate
                    speech or threat to harm others. Do not endorsed the Nazis,
                    the KKK, or any similar group. Genocide apologia is not allow here.
                    Similarly, saying that a certain group "deserved to suffer" through
                    oppression is also not allowed. Do not glorify violence, self-harm,
                    suicide, or animal abuse.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>No explicit content.</b> Since our users are quite young, 
                    don't post any sexual content (e.g., nudity). Sharing or attempting 
                    to share content that sexualised children or normalised child sexual 
                    abuse will result in an instant ban. Sharing real media showing
                    explicit excessive violence with the intention to harass or disgust people
                    will also result in an instant ban.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>We are here for reading.</b> Do not use your account
                    for spamming or to scam others. Doing so would result in a ban.
                    We are here for reading, so don't just come here to post advertisements.
                    Do not come to our platform to spread misinformation. If you try to
                    spread misinformation (e.g., climate change denial, flat earth, anti-vaccines),
                    you will be warned.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Do not come with malicious intent.</b> Do not use
                    OBB with malicious intent. In other words, do not attempt
                    to scam or hack us and do not use this site for illegal activities - 
                    you must follow the law.
                    This rule also includes - do not blackmail people or threaten to leak
                    private information or attempt to impersonate somebody on OBB.</p></li>
